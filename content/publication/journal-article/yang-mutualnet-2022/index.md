abstract: 'Most existing deep neural networks are static, which means they can only do inference at a fixed complexity. But the resource budget can vary substantially across different devices. Even on a single device, the affordable budget can change with different scenarios, and repeatedly training networks for each required budget would be incredibly expensive. Therefore, in this work, we propose a general method called MutualNet to train a single network that can run at a diverse set of resource constraints. Our method trains a cohort of model configurations with various network widths and input resolutions. This mutual learning scheme not only allows the model to run at different width-resolution configurations but also transfers the unique knowledge among these configurations, helping the model to learn stronger representations overall. MutualNet is a general training methodology that can be applied to various network structures (e.g., 2D networks: MobileNets, ResNet, 3D networks: SlowFast, X3D) and various tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, segmentation, and action recognition), and is demonstrated to achieve consistent improvements on a variety of datasets. Since we only train the model once, it also greatly reduces the training cost compared to independently training several models.'
