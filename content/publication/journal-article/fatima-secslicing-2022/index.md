abstract: 'Network slicing is one of the emerging technologies allowing resource sharing among different
network entities in 5G networks. It enables delivering smart, critical, and multi-services with distinctive
requirements transiting from network as an infrastructure to network as a service setup. Although its
advantages, it is facing several challenges raised from isolation and resource sharing among services leading
to security issues. Security is a critical problem for network slicing as slices serving customized services
with different requirements may also have different security levels and policies. Thus, considering the
impact of these security issues on network slices is required when defining and designing security protocols.
Addressing these challenges is necessary to protect usersâ€™ security and privacy while maintaining the required
performance and QoS. Most of the existing works covered only one or more aspects of the network slicing
including, architecture, taxonomy, challenges, security issues, attacks classification, possible solutions, and
future scope. In this paper, we extensively investigated all these aspects and others, we analyzed how the
security can be ensured inside and outside of the network slices with resource isolation, machine learning,
and cryptography with an E2E security. We presented a deep review of the security issues threatening the
network slicing and how to mitigate them over a multi-domain infrastructure in 5G networks. we evaluated
the performance of some of these solutions in preventing malicious attacks through experiments using Open
Air Interface'
